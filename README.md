# Trigonometry-homework-helper
This is a python program I've built to help with my trigonometry homework. 
Currently it can only help you find legs and the hypotenuse and it can also help you find the six trigonometric functions.
Please feel free to add or ask me to add more features to help you with your math homework.
A GUI for the program might be coming later.
I will try to add more to the program as often as i can, i currently have a few ideas in mind.
This is my very first GitHub project and i'm more than open to new idea and i would love if others helped improve this program.
